When you start the game, you will be ready to drive.

Press LEFT/RIGHT arrows to move up and down the track.
Press the UP/DOWN arrows to accelerate/brake.

If you manage to slow all the way down, you will begin to drive backwards,
although this is pretty pointless.

Press 1 to switch to free roam mode.
Press 2 to switch back to first person mode.

In free roam mode, you have full 3D camera controls.

Click and hold the left mouse button and drag to rotate.
Press W/S to move forward or backward in the direction you are
facing. Note that this direction is projected onto the XY plane
to avoid you moving slower or faster when looking down.
Press A/D to strafe left or right.
Press R/F to move up or down.

Enjoy!
